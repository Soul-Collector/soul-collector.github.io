## Understanding Reverse Polarity Circuits

This blog post will go over the details and different ways of implementing a reverse polarity circuits. 

Reverse polarity protection is necessary in order to ensure that no damage occurs to the protected components in a given circuit when the polarity of the supply voltage reverses.

[ISO 16750-2:2023](https://www.iso.org/standard/76119.html) provides detailed requirements for reverse battery protection in terms of voltage levels and timings to ensure that the electronic equipment can withstand reverse battery voltage without getting damaged or malfunctioning. 


The standard specifies that the electronic equipment should be able to withstand a reverse voltage of up to 60V for a period of 100ms. This means that the equipment should not be damaged or malfunction when a reverse voltage is applied to it for a period of 100ms. 


It's worth noting that the standard requires testing of the equipment under reverse voltage conditions at both room temperature and elevated temperature to ensure that the equipment can withstand reverse voltage under different temperature conditions.


Additionally, the standard recommends that the duration of reverse voltage testing should be increased to 1s for electronic equipment that is critical to the safety of the vehicle or its occupants. This means that electronic equipment that is critical to the vehicle's safety or the safety of its occupants should be able to withstand reverse voltage for a longer period of time without getting damaged or malfunctioning.


Therefore, the standard provides detailed requirements for reverse battery protection in terms of voltage levels and timings to ensure that the electronic equipment can withstand harsh environmental conditions and unexpected events such as reverse battery connection, especially for critical systems.
